# simplySocial

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1. and  [bourbon neat generator](https://github.com/koolth/generator-bourbon-neat) version 1.0.0

this is a personal project to attempt to build out the front end of [simply social](https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/2BAT3RAH8Q7/)

Updated! [live preview!](http://kevingarcia.me)

## Build & development

This assumes you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed (if you're still setting up Yeoman, you can check out the [official documentation](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html)).

If you don't have them installed, you can do so via running the command:
`$ npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli`

Clone or fork the repo:
`$ git clone https://github.com/kgcreative/simply-social`

Install the dependencies from the package.json file to the project:
`$ npm install`

Install the Bower dependencies 
`$ bower update`

Run `$ grunt` to initialize the build

Run `$ grunt serve` to initialize the environment with a local webserver & LiveReload.

## Post Mortem:

I bit a bit more than I could chew by attempting to develop a fully featured UI. I should have simply built out the pages one by one with their resulting CSS. This would have resulted in a > 1 week build time. With that said, I learned a few things, and I will be taking this into consideration the next time I need to scaffold a project.
